"This is the first option!" [(4,"Option 1"),(7,"Option 2"),(9, "Option 3")], the idea here is that the numbers tell us which line to jump to and the quotes next to those numbers are the options to display.

"If you made it here and picked Option 2, it's good!"

"If you made it here and picked Option 3, it's good!"
